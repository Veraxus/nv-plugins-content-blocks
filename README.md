## NOUVEAU [X] Content Blocks ##

A lightweight WordPress plugin that allows you to define/delimit content blocks for any content, and then output those blocks in theme templates.

### Description ###

This plugin adds a "Block" button to your WordPress editor screens, allowing you to easily separate your content into blocks using the visual editor. In the text editor, simply add new blocks using the <!--block--> comment.

You can then load specific blocks anywhere in your template files using the new the_content_block() function.
