A lightweight WordPress plugin that allows you to define/delimit content blocks for any content, and then output those blocks in theme templates.

== Description ==

This plugin adds a "Block" button to your WordPress editor screens, allowing you to easily separate your content into blocks using the visual editor. In the text editor, simply add new blocks using the <!--block--> comment.

You can then load specific blocks anywhere in your template files using the new the_content_block() function.

This example is part of the NOUVEAU WordPress framework. For more great starting code, search for "Nouveau" in the WordPress.org's plugins or visit [www.nouveauframework.com]
